## Exercise 1
In the `en.coderslab.homeworks.arrays` package, in the `Main01.java` file place a method with the signature `public static double dogAge(double dogAge)` which will calculate the age of a dog in dog years.

* the function should take the dogâ€™s age as a parameter,
* for the first two years, each year a dog gains 10.5 years of age,
* over two years old, every year a dog gains 4 years of age,
* the function should return the age of the dog.

##### Example:
```
dogAge(1.5)  # expected result: 1.5 * 10.5 = 15.75

dogAge(5)  # expected result: 2 * 10.5 + 3 * 4 = 33
```


## Exercise 2

In the `en.coderslab.homeworks.arrays` package, place a method with the signature `public static boolean divisibleBy(int a, int b)` in the file `Main02.java`: 

1. Complete the body of the method so that it returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the variable `a` is divisible by `b`.
