## Exercise 1

In the `pl.coderslab.homeworks.multiarrays` package in the `Main01.java` file, place a method with the signature `public static int oddSum(int[][] arr)`.
 
1. Fill in the body of the method so that it adds up the values of all elements under the odd indexes.
2. The method should return the sum.

Example: 
for the array int arr[][] = {{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}; 
int sum = 2 + 5;


## Exercise 2

In the `pl.coderslab.homeworks.multiarrays` package in the file `Main02.java`, place a method with the signature `public static int[] minimum(int[][] arr)`.
 
1. Fill in the body of the method so that for the obtained 2-dimensional array, the method calculates the minimum value of each of its rows.
2. The individual minimum values should be placed in an array that the method returns.


## Exercise 3

In the `pl.coderslab.homeworks.multiarrays` package in the file `Main03.java`, place a method with the signature `public static int[] lessMore(int[][] arr)`.
 
1. Fill in the body of the method so that the arithmetic mean is calculated for the received 2-dimensional array.
2. Calculate how many elements are less than and how many greater than the mean.
3. The method should return an array consisting of 2 elements: 1 - number of elements that are less than the mean, 2 - number of elements greater than the mean.
